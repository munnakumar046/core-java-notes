History of Java
===============
In 1990, Sun Micro System took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic 
device which can be controlled by a remote like setup. That time project was called Stealth
project and later it is renamed to Green project.

James Gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project. They met
in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with Graphic System. James Gosling thought 
to use C and C++ languages to develop the project. But the problem what they have faced is 
C and C++ languages are system dependent. Then James Gosling decided , why don't we create
our own programming language which is system independent. 

In 1991, They have developed a programming language called an OAK. OAK means strength, itself
is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many contries like Germany , France, 
USA and etc.

Later in 1995, they have renamed OAK to Java. Java is a island of an Indonasia where first 
coffee of seed was produced. During the development of project they were consuming lot of 
coffee's.Hence the symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.
