Comments in Java
=================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommended to use comments in our regular programming.

Diagram: class1.1

Comments will not display in output because they won't compiled by the compiler.

In java, we have two types of comments.

1) Single Line Comment 

2) Multiple Line Comment 


1) Single Line Comment
-----------------------
It is used to comment a single line.
ex:
	// comment here 


2) Multiple Line Comment 
-----------------------
It is used to comment multiple lines.
ex:
	/*

		-
		-  comment here 
		-
	*/

ex:
---
//class declaration 
class Test
{

	//main method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		//variable declaration 
		int x = 10;

		//output stmt
		System.out.println(x); 
	}
}


Interview Questions
===================

Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM ?

JDK
----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

JDK is a installable software which consist of Java Runtime Environment( JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM)  , compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar) , document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development.


JRE
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
It provides very good environment to run java applications only.


JVM
---
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.

JVM is a interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure and it 
converts byte code to machine code.
