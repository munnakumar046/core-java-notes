Naming conventions in Java
===========================
In java, uppercase letters will consider as different and lowercase letters will consider as 
different.Hence we consider java is a case sensitive programming language.

As java is a case sensitive, we must and should follow naming conventions for following things.

ex:
	classes
	interfaces
	variables
	methods
	keywords
	packages and 
	constants 

classes
--------
In java, a class name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple 
words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined classes		userdefined classes
	--------------------		---------------------
	System				Test
	FileWriter 			DemoApp	
	BufferedReader 			ExampleApp
	File				EmployeeDetails
	StringBuilder 			StudentInfo
	and etc.			and etc.


interfaces
-----------
In java, an interface name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains 
multiple words then each inner word must and should starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined interfaces		userdefined interfaces
	---------------------		---------------------
	Runnable 			ITest	
	Serializable 			IDemoApp 
	ListIterator 			IStudentInfo
	Enumeration 			IDepartment
	and etc.			and etc.


variables
---------
In java, a variable name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple
words then each inner word must and should starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined variables		userdefined variables
	---------------------		---------------------
	out				i
	in				empId
	err				studName
	length 				deptNo
	and etc.			and etc.

Methods
--------
In java, a method name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple 
words then each inner word must and should starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined methods		userdefined methods
	-------------------		--------------------
	getPriority()			getStudentInfo()
	setName()			setBillDetails()
	getClass()			calculateBillAmt()
	hashCode()			and etc.
	toString()
	and etc.

keywords
--------
In java, all keywords we need to declare under lowercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined keywords
	-------------------
	if , else, do, while, break, public, static, void and etc.

packages
----------
In java, all packages we need to declare under lowercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined packages		userdefined packages
	-----------------		--------------------
	java.lang 			com.ihub.www
	java.util			com.google.www
	java.time			com.qt.www
	java.text			and etc.
	java.util.stream 
	java.sql
	and etc.

constants 
-----------
In java, all constants we need to declare under uppercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined constants		userdefined constants
	-----------------		-------------------
	MAX_PRIORITY			LIMIT=10;
	MIN_PRIORITY
	NORM_PRIORITY
	MAX_VALUE
	MIN_VALUE
	and etc.
