Main method 
============
Our program contains main method or not.

Either it is properly declared or not.

It is not a responsibility of a compiler to check. It is a liability of a JVM to look for main method always at runtime.

If JVM won't find main method then it will throw one runtime error called main method not found.

JVM always look for main method with following signature.

signature:
--------
	public static  void  main(String[] args)

If we perform any changes in above signature then JVM Will throw one runtime error called main method not found.


Q) Explain main method in java?

public 
------
	JVM wants to call main method from anywhere. 

static
------
	JVM wants to call main method without using object reference.

void
-----
	Main method does not return anything to JVM. 

main
----
	It is a identifier given to a main method.


String[] args
-----------
	It is a command line argument.



We can perform following changes in main method.

1) Order of modifiers is not important. Incase of public static we can declare static public also.
   ex:
	static public  void main(String[] args)


2) We can change String[] in following acceptable formats.
   ex:
	public static  void main(String[]  args)
	public static  void main(String   []args)
	public static  void main(String  args[])	
 

3) We can change String[] with var-arg parameter.
   ex:
	public static void main(String... args)


4) We can replace args with any java valid identifier.


5) Main method will accept following modifiers. 
   ex:
	synchronized 
	strictfp
	final 


Command line arguments
======================
Arguments which are passing through command prompt such type of arguments are called command line 
arguments.

In command line arguments we need to pass input values at runtime command.

ex:
	javac   Test.java

	java    Test  101  raja  M  1000.0
			|   |	 |   |____ args[3]	
 			|   |    |________ args[2]
			|   |_____________ args[1]
			|_________________ args[0]

ex:
---
class Test
{
	public static void main(String[]   args)
	{
		System.out.println(args[0]);
		System.out.println(args[1]);
		System.out.println(args[2]);
		System.out.println(args[3]);
	}
}


System.out.println()
=====================
It is a output statement in java.

Whenever we want to display any data or user defined statements then we need to use output stmt.

syntax:
-----
	static variable 
		|
	System.out.println();
	|		|
predefined 		predefined method
final class
